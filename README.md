# VipraTech â€” Django + Stripe Assignment

This is a minimal scaffold for the Django + Stripe assignment. It includes:
- A small Django project (`project/`) and app (`shop/`) with 3 fixed products seeded in `products_seed.json`.
- A single HTML page showing products and a "Buy" button that uses Stripe Checkout (test mode).
- Basic webhook handling stub (verify and mark order paid).
- .env.example and notes.

This scaffold is for demonstration and local development. Replace Stripe test keys in `.env`.

See `README_RUN.md` for quick run instructions.
